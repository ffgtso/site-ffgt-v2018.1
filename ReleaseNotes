Release Notes for gluon-ffgt-@@RELEASE@@

This Freifunk Firmware is based off Gluon v2018.1 and modified by several additional, non-standard modules:

 - modified $GLUON/package/gluon-setup-mode/luasrc/lib/gluon/upgrade/320-setup-ifname
   and $GLUON/package/gluon-setup-mode/files/lib/gluon/setup-mode/rc.d/S20network so
   that node a) uses WAN (if existing) for setup mode and b) is DHCP client â€” just like
   in Freifunk mode.
